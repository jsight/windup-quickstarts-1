[[what-is-it]]
== What is it?

In this example, the fictional "Proprietary" corporation provides its own proprietary servlet and filter annotations for dependency injection. 
If your application uses them, they must be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 annotations. 

These examples demonstrate how to create a Windup rule add-on that searches for these proprietary annotations and reports on them.

The rule searches for the following annotations:

* _@ProprietaryServlet_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebServlet_ annotation.
* _@ProprietaryFilter_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebFilter_ annotation.
* _@ProprietaryInitParam_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebInitParam_ annotation.

You can create Windup rule add-ons using Java or XML. This quickstart provides examples of both types of rules.

* link:rules-java/README.adoc[Java rule add-on]: Follow the instructions here to see how to create a Java rule add-on.
* link:rules-xml/README.adoc[XML rule]: Follow the instructions here to see how to create an XML rule.

WARNING: If you deploy both the Java-based rule add-on and XML rule at the same time, you will see double the story points!
